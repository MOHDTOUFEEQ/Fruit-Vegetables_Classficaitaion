# Fruit & Vegetable Classification using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying fruits and vegetables using a deep learning model. The classification model is built using **TensorFlow/Keras** and trained on an image dataset of various fruits and vegetables. The goal is to develop an accurate model that can differentiate between multiple categories.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of different fruits and vegetables. It can be obtained from sources like:
- Kaggle: [Example Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henningheyen/lvis-fruits-and-vegetables-dataset))
- Custom dataset (uploaded to Google Drive or other sources)

Each image is labeled according to the type of fruit or vegetable it represents.

## Model Architecture
The classification model is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built using TensorFlow/Keras. The key components of the model include:
- **Conv2D Layers** for feature extraction
- **MaxPooling2D Layers** for downsampling
- **Flatten Layer** to convert feature maps into a 1D vector
- **Dense Layers** for classification
- **Softmax Activation** for multi-class classification

## Installation & Dependencies
To run the notebook in **Google Colab**, install dependencies using:
```python
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Dependencies:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fruit-Vegetables_Classification.git
   ```
2. **Open the Colab notebook** and run the cells in order.
3. **Upload dataset** to Google Drive or use an online dataset.
4. **Train the model** and evaluate accuracy.
5. **Test with new images** to classify fruits and vegetables.

## Model Training
The model is trained on labeled images using:
```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
```
### Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Loss
- Confusion Matrix

## Results
